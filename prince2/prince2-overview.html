        <h1>PRINCE2 Overview</h1>
        
        <div class="intro">
            <p><strong>PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments)</strong> is a process-based project management method that provides a structured framework for managing projects of any size or complexity.</p>
            <p>The 7th Edition introduces refined practices, enhanced management approaches, and updated guidance for modern project delivery including sustainability, digital transformation, and people-centric leadership.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What is PRINCE2?</h2>
        <p>PRINCE2 is a widely adopted project management methodology used globally across industries and sectors. It provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A controlled start, middle, and end to projects</li>
            <li>Regular reviews of progress against plan and business case</li>
            <li>Flexible decision points for project continuation</li>
            <li>Automatic management control of deviations from plan</li>
            <li>Involvement of stakeholders at appropriate times</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Five Elements of PRINCE2</h2>
        <p>PRINCE2 7th Edition is built on five foundational elements that work together:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Element</th>

        </table>

        <h2>The Seven Principles</h2>
        <p>PRINCE2 principles are universal best practices that must always be applied:</p>

        <table>
