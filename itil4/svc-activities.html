    <h2>Service Value Chain Activities - Detailed Guide</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>1. Plan</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>Planning ensures a shared understanding of the vision, current status, and improvement direction for all four dimensions and all products and services across the organization.</p>
      <h4>Key Messages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Shared Understanding:</b> It is critical that all stakeholders have a common interpretation of plans, goals, and visions. This goes beyond simple agreement to genuine mutual comprehension.</li>
        <li><b>All Four Dimensions:</b> Planning must address organization and people, information and technology, partners and suppliers, and value streams and processes.</li>
        <li><b>Across the Organization:</b> Planning involves everyone, including those who may be difficult to engage.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing the vision and direction for improvement</li>
        <li>Understanding current status across all four dimensions</li>
        <li>Communicating plans effectively to all stakeholders</li>

      <h3>2. Improve</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>This activity focuses on continual improvement of products, services, and practices across all value chain activities and the four dimensions of service management.</p>
      <h4>Key Messages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Everything is subject to improvement—governance, value creation, practices, and all organizational aspects.</li>
        <li>If things are not improving, they are getting worse; stability is not an option.</li>
        <li>Continual improvement is a core component pervasive throughout the Service Value System.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifying improvement opportunities</li>
        <li>Building business cases for improvements</li>
        <li>Planning and implementing improvements</li>
        <li>Measuring and evaluating improvement results</li>
        <li>Coordinating improvement ideas across the organization</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>3. Engage</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>The engage activity provides a good understanding of stakeholder needs, transparency, and continual engagement and good relationships with all stakeholders.</p>
      <h4>Key Messages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Understanding:</b> Not just asking or presuming, but ensuring genuine shared comprehension of needs.</li>
        <li><b>Transparency:</b> Keeping things honest, clear, and easy to follow; avoiding jargon and maintaining open channels.</li>
        <li><b>Continual Engagement:</b> This is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process of keeping stakeholders involved.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding stakeholder needs and requirements</li>
        <li>Maintaining continuous communication with all stakeholders</li>

      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>4. Design and Transition</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>Ensures that products and services continually meet stakeholder expectations for quality, costs, and time to market.</p>
      <h4>Key Messages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Both design and transition are intimately linked with stakeholder expectations.</li>
        <li>Success requires knowing who the stakeholders are and what their expectations entail.</li>
        <li>Delivering expectations OR changing them—modifying expectations is often the only viable way when people expect the impossible.</li>
        <li>Better to change expectations at the design stage to ensure satisfaction at transition.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing new or changed services to meet requirements</li>
        <li>Ensuring services meet quality, cost, and time-to-market targets</li>
        <li>Transitioning services into live environments</li>
        <li>Testing and validating service components</li>
        <li>Managing stakeholder expectations throughout design and transition</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>5. Obtain/Build</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>Ensures that service components are available when and where they are needed and meet agreed specifications.</p>
      <h4>Key Messages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Get the right components, at the right time, to the right place.</li>
        <li>Success depends on understanding what is needed and how components will be used.</li>
        <li>Reinforces the need for shared understanding across the value chain.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Acquiring or building service components</li>
        <li>Ensuring components meet specifications</li>
        <li>Managing suppliers and contracts</li>
        <li>Quality assurance of components</li>
        <li>Making components available for deployment</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>6. Deliver and Support</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>Ensures that services are delivered and supported according to agreed specifications and stakeholders' expectations.</p>
      <h4>Key Messages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver and support the <b>entire service</b>, not just software applications or individual components.</li>
        <li>Services include training, documentation, intuitiveness, and ongoing updates.</li>
        <li>The definition separates <i>agreed specifications</i> and <i>stakeholder expectations</i>—these rarely align perfectly.</li>
        <li>Specifications may not represent shared understanding; things change; people make errors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Delivering services to users and customers</li>
        <li>Providing ongoing support and maintenance</li>
        <li>Managing incidents and service requests</li>
        <li>Communicating with users to keep expectations met</li>
        <li>Ensuring service continuity and availability</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Service Value Streams</h3>
      <p>Service value streams are specific paths through the Service Value Chain. They represent the end-to-end activities undertaken to deliver particular outcomes, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incident resolution</li>
        <li>New feature delivery</li>
        <li>Service request fulfillment</li>
        <li>Change implementation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each value stream leverages different combinations and sequences of the six SVC activities. There are multiple ways to move through the value chain, and each represents a distinct value stream tailored to specific organizational needs and contexts.</p>
      <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Service Value System (SVS)</b> – The overarching model</li>
        <li><b>Service Value Chain (SVC)</b> – The six interconnected activities</li>
        <li><b>Service Value Streams</b> – Specific combinations of activities for particular outcomes</li>
      </ol>
