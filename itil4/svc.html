    <h2>Service Value Chain (SVC)</h2>
    <section>
      <p>The Service Value Chain (SVC) is the core of ITIL 4's Service Value System. It outlines the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value realization through the creation and management of products and services. The SVC is an operating model for service management, encompassing the following activities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Plan</b>: Ensures a shared understanding of the vision, current status, and direction for improvement across all dimensions, products, and services.</li>
        <li><b>Improve</b>: Focuses on continual improvement of products, services, and practices across all value chain activities and dimensions.</li>
        <li><b>Engage</b>: Provides understanding of stakeholder needs, transparency, continual engagement, and relationships with all stakeholders.</li>
        <li><b>Design and Transition</b>: Ensures products and services continually meet stakeholder expectations for quality, cost, and time to market.</li>
        <li><b>Obtain/Build</b>: Ensures service components are available when and where needed, and meet agreed specifications.</li>
        <li><b>Deliver and Support</b>: Ensures services are delivered and supported according to specifications and stakeholder expectations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Service Value Streams</h3>
      <p>Service value streams are specific paths within the Value Chain, such as incident resolution, new feature delivery, or more. Each value stream is a set of steps or activities designed to deliver a particular outcome, leveraging the above SVC activities.</p>
