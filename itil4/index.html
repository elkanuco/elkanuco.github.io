    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Delivering quality services is essential for business growth and survival. IT is integral to all businesses, enabling improved services for competition, cost savings, and customer satisfaction. Today, customers expect faster and more transparent services, leading organizations to innovate and increasingly digitalize their service offerings. However, delivering value depends not just on innovation but also on strong IT service management practices.</p>
    <p>ITIL 4 provides guidance for organizations to deliver quality IT services, focusing on attitudes, behaviors, and continual improvement that underpin and guide effective service management.</p>
    <h3>How ITIL 4 Helps Organizations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Offers frameworks and proven best practices for service management.</li>
      <li>Provides ideas and approaches for improving service delivery and value creation.</li>
      <li>Facilitates learning from common challenges and solutions.</li>
      <li>Helps in developing the ability to ask better organizational service-related questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What ITIL 4 Does Not Do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not provide precise answers for every unique situation.</li>
      <li>Does not replace the need for management, good sense, or context-driven decision making.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Service Value and Improvement</h3>
    <p>Organizations should aim to balance customer needs with the costs of delivering services. Improvement is a continuous process: understanding the value of services is the foundation for ongoing enhancement, faster delivery, or cost optimization.</p>
    <p>ITIL 4 is considered a set of 'best practices'â€”proven ways of working that should be adapted for local context and requirements, driven by good sense, responsibility, and self-knowledge.</p>
